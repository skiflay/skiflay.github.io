Absolute path = c/desktop/css/img.jpg
Relative path = ../../css/img.jpg
N.B. Itâ€™s always good to use relative path, bcz when it goes to server, the structure of the file might change.

Unobstrusive vs Obstrusive JS
e.g <button onclick= "dosomething()">  ==> Obstrusive

e.g const okButton = document.getElementById("id");  ==> Unobstrusive
    okButton.onclick = okayClick;

when we put JS Script tag at the bottom, the browser executes the JS file first before the html is executed.
But still modern JS conventions recommend at the Top by using window.loading, async ...
E.g <script src="..." type="text/js defer || async></script>
